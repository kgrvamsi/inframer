- Distributed infra:
  - Webserver setup

- Data consistency:
  - Let's face it - no matter how automated your processes are - you will always have that one vm you created 6 months ago for a customer demo.

- Pre Analyzer demo:
  - This is where it all comes together

- Post analyzer demo:
  - When you have data aggregated in a consumable way there are no limits to what you can do
  - Without analysis data is lame and without data analysis is blind

- Conclusion
  - I am sure most of you have queried AWS, got instances, stored them in ds, analyzed them and spit out the result
  - Don't keep that process opaque
  - Collect it, dump it, expose it, consume it and make sense of it
